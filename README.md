# Cycrus

:microbe: This is the profile of Cycrus, or Cyril, a scientific psychologist currently studying computer sciences
and working in the automotive industry.

:microbe: I have a strong interest in neural network architectures and interdisciplinarily connecting this area
of computer science with psychological concepts.

:microbe: My current private main project is the development of a spiking neural network architecture calles COGNA
(Cognitive Organized Generalized Neural Approach) inspired more on biological neural learning functions
than most state of the art network types.

:microbe: (Currently all my repositories are on private until I am sure the network concepts can work in their
intended purposes)

:microbe: Let's do some research!
