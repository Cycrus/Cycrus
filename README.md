This is the profile of Cycrus, or Cyril, a scientific psychologist currently studying computer sciences
and working in the automotive industry.

I have a strong interest in neural network architectures and interdisciplinarily connecting this area
of computer science with psychological concepts.
My current private main project is the development of a spiking neural network architecture calles COGNA
(Cognitive Organized Generalized Neural Approach) inspired more on biological neural learning functions
than most state of the art network types.

Let's do some research!
